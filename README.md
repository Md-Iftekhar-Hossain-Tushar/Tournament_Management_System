# Tournament_Management_System
Tournament Management system for maintaining sports in a better and easier way. Traditionally when a tournament is organized storing and processing of data with paperwork is so difficult. To remove this drawback we developed this tournament management system for maintaining sports. This project is functionalized to organize teams for adding, editing, removing and so on.  Teams' data are managed in a good manner. We designed, developed, and created a database in part by part for handling this project. Our main goal is to solve this real-life problem more functionally.
